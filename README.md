# JordanReleases

This application allows a user to see the Air Jordan sneaker release dates for the months between January through June. The user can see the sneaker names that will be released for a given month and can also see the corresponding release dates for when the sneakers will be released for purchase.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jordan_releases'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jordan_releases

## Usage

TODO: Once you've installed the application and have ensured you are in the Jordan_Releases file, you can run the program by typing the following in your terminal, (./bin/jordan_releases). You will then be prompted to select a month to be given the Air Jordan sneaker rleases for the selected month. Once the month is selected, a list will be populated with the names of the sneaker releases for that month. The user will then have the option to see the exact release dates (Month - Day) for the sneakers listed in that month, go back to the list of months so see other sneaker releases or exit the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
